      <p>
        My favorite movie is The Great Gatsby from 2013. The reason why this is
        my favorite movie is because of this movie has a modernized storytelling
        version from the original 1925 novel by American writer
        <b><i> F. Scott Fitzgerald </i></b>
        . In addition, this movie has 2 of my favorite actors -
        <b>Leonardo DiCaprio</b>
        and <b>Tobey Maguire</b>! I recommend if anyone is having a movie night,
        The Great Gatsby should be on their movie watch list!

      <p>
        I have lots of favorite songs, and many artists from different music
        genres. But my number one artist is <b>"The Weeknd"</b>. Particularly I
        really love his music making talents and melodies that he creates. Even
        though his lyrics are very "explicit", I enjoy the creative and
        consistent atmosphere he makes for listeners, and most of all how he is
        able to convey relatable emotions in his songs for anyone to feel.
